# In-Chat Project by Inbal & Noa
Meet our chat for contact and share data.
## The required installations. 
The installations should be inside the app directory.
* npm

## What our chat do?
We created an hard coded chat, which support sharing data, such as text messages, pictures, videos, recordings.
### How should i use the chat?
The first page that appears when we start runing, is the login page. You can enter through
by logging in with one of the hard coded users provided below
(for example, we recommend using the following user - username = inba33, password = 1020).
A second way to enter is by registering, which is linked to on the login page.
### What happend when i enter?
When you enter the chat, all the conversations with other users will appear.
Of course if you registered then you will not see any existing conversations.
You can click on any possible user and contact with him. you can according to the appropriate icons send the desired data.
You also can add new conversation with one of the existing users. 
## usernames and their passwords :
